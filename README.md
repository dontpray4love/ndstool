# NDSTool v1.27

This fork was made because of the need of generating the *bootloader.nds* used by HiyaCFW, because starting with v1.29 the RAM offset was moved and some other stuff were added to the generated output file, so the custom firmware does not boot with a bootloader generated by those versions.

libelf is still needed to build this, also the raw2c binary from the devKitPro general tools, which can be compiled from [this source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devkitPro/general-tools/master/raw2c.c).

Build process tested in Windows (32-bit MinGW), 32-bit Debian Stretch and MacOS High Sierra.
